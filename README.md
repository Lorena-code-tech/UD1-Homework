## What is in this repo
**UD1_homework.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook with the solution to the three problems proposed.
Problems 1 and 2 have been solved jointly, and Problem 3 is discussed separately after the first two.

- Generating several gaussian, uniform and beta distributions and plotting them (histograms + theoretical curves)
- Empirical vs Theoretical variance comparison
- Confidence interval comparison (Hoeffding vs Chebyshev)
- Analysis of the 68-95-99.7 rule

**requirements.txt** contains the needed packages

**images** contains all the graphs generated in the code

## How to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook UD1_homework.ipynb
